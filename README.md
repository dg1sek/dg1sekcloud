Everything I want to run on my OVH VPS cloud server... in one setup. 
The packaging here is not yet very nice and remains to be cleaned up.

The (final) setup for my cloud system shall comprise:
- NGINX PROXY
- NGINX WEB SERVER
- LetsEncrypt HTTPS certificates
- HTTP2 support
- IPv6 support
- OpenVPN server
- Iptables Firewall Rules for both IPv4 and IPv6
- Fail2ban setup to protect in particular the nextcloud server
- Wordpress site

I started working on this in October 2018. Comments welcome.
